# ASCII Art
 
## Synopsis
Do you feel you are an artist at heart? Unfortunately you are a programmer :( Why not give a try at ...
 
In this puzzle, transform strings of characters into ASCII ART.

## Goal
In stations and airports you often see this type of screen:

Have you ever asked yourself how it might be possible to simulate this display on a good old terminal? We have: with ASCII art! The goal of the problem is to simulate an old airport terminal display: your program must display a line of text in ASCII art. You have to split strings, store them and recreate others. You can use data structures like arrays or hash tables.

## Rules
ASCII art allows you to represent forms by using characters. To be precise, in our case, these forms are words.
 
Your mission is to write a program that can display a line of text in ASCII art in a style you are given as input.
